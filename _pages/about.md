<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, this is Wenna Han, a third-year Ph.D. student at [Wilson College of Textiles](https://textiles.ncsu.edu/tatm/) at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu), advised by [Dr. Yingjiao Xu](https://textiles.ncsu.edu/people/yxu11/). My research primarily focuses on consumer behavior regarding innovations and technologies within the fashion industry. I also received my Master of Science degree in Textiles with a minor in Statistics at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu). Prior to that, I got my Bachelor of Science degree in Textile Engineering and Textile Design with a minor in Public Relations at [Donghua University](https://english.dhu.edu.cn/).

My scholarly pursuits are deeply rooted in understanding consumer behavior within the rapidly evolving fashion and retail industries. At the core of my research is the exploration of how novel products and innovative retail technologies reshape consumer perceptions and experiences. I am also intrigued by the dynamics of consumer well-being and shopping behaviors in rapidly changing market environments.
