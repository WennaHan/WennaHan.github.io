<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, I’m Wenna Han, currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Marketing at the [Gies College of Business](https://giesbusiness.illinois.edu/), University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I received my Ph.D. in Textile Technology Management from North Carolina State University in 2024.

My scholarly pursuits are rooted in understanding consumer behavior within the evolving fashion and retail industries. My primary research interest is to explore how novel products and innovative retail technologies reshape consumer perceptions and experiences. I am also intrigued by the dynamics of consumer well-being and shopping behaviors in rapidly changing market environments.
